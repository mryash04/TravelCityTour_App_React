                <p>Australia is globally famous for its natural wonders, wide-open 
                spaces, beaches, deserts, "The Bush", and "The Outback". 
                Australia is one of the world's most highly urbanised countries; 
                it's well known for its attractive mega cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth.</p>

                <p>The City of London is a city, ceremonial county and local 
                    government district[note 1] that contains the historic centre and 
                    the primary central business district (CBD) of London. It 
                    constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans 
                    in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the modern city 
                    named London has since grown far beyond the City of London boundary.[4][5] 
                    The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a 
                    notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local 
                    authority districts of London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a 
                    status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, 
                    the City of Westminster). It is also a separate ceremonial 
                    county, being an enclave surrounded by Greater London, and is the smallest 
                    county in the United Kingdom.</p>
